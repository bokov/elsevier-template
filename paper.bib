  volume = {30},

  doi = {10.1016/0531-5565(95)00029-1},
  abstract = {The Gompertz demographic model describes rates of aging and age-independent mortality with the parameters $\alpha$ and A, respectively. Estimates of these parameters have traditionally been based on the assumption that mortality rates are constant over short to moderate time periods. This assumption is questionable even for very large samples assayed over short time intervals. In this article, we compare several methods for estimating the Gompertz parameters, including some that do not assume constant mortality rates. A maximum likelihood method that does not assume constant mortality rates is shown to be best, based on the bias and variance of the Gompertz parameter estimates. Moreover, we show how the Gompertz equation can then be used to predict mean longevity and the time of the nth percentile of mortality. Methods are also developed that assign confidence intervals to such estimates. In some cases, these statistics may be estimated accurately from only the early deaths of a large cohort, thus providing an opportunity to estimate longevity on long-lived organisms quickly.},

  abstract = {A general measure of the rate of senescence is the acceleration of mortality rate, represented here by the time required for the mortality rate to double (MRD). Rhesus monkeys have an MRD close to that of humans, about 8 years; their shorter life-span results mainly from higher mortality at all ages. In contrast, some groups with short life-spans (rodents and galliform birds) have shorter MRDs and faster senescence. On the basis of the Gompertz mortality rate model, one may estimate the MRD from the maximum life-span (tmax) and the overall population mortality rate. Such calculations show that certain birds have MRDs that are as long as that of humans. These results show that high overall mortality rates or small body sizes do not preclude slow rates of senescence.},
